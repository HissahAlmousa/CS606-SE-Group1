### Academic Advisor Software. 

#### 1. Idea: 
- As a student, we may face difficulties arranging an appropriate time to meet with the academic advisor for any reason. This software will help the student to get 		in touch with the advisor without actually annoying him by sending messages back and forth for that purpose. On the other hand, the advisor will have an access to 		 the software in order to manage their availability and appointments with students. 

#### 2. Objectives/Goals:
- To investigate the requirements for building the proposed system.
- To facilitate the access of academic advisors to their students during office hours by knowing the students who have booked an appointment with him.
- To develop the proposed academic advisor software in order to facilitate communication between students and their academic advisors.
